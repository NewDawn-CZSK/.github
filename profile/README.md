## NewDawn CZ

We are a community of people living in different parts of our country, which for many years met, among other things, at the New Dawn charismatic conference in Walsingham, England.

After years of internal growth, the desire to organize this conference in the Czech Republic and convey its atmosphere to others has matured in us.

Our motivation is to give away what we have been able to draw on for years in England, according to the sentence from Scripture: "Freely you have received, freely give" (Mt 10:8).

Our desire is that everyone who comes to the conference will experience the community of a living church, be enriched with new experiences of God's goodness and be filled with the gifts of the Holy Spirit.

## NewDawn SK

The Catholic Pilgrimage Conference New Dawn is an event where we gather with the desire to create a community, at least for a few days, in which there would be a place for people of all ages, for children, young and old, and where we could experience the fullness of riches together as a big family of the Catholic faith.

The conference takes place at the beautiful pilgrimage site Skalka near Trenčín, which has been imbued with the spiritual legacy of St. Andrej Svorad and Beňadik. We live directly below the Benedictine monastery Veľká Skalka (see map below), where we also draw from the natural beauty of this extraordinary place.

The content of the program is inspired by the New Dawn conference in England. It will be thematically divided into: Pilgrimage Day (Saturday), Reconciliation Day (Sunday), Healing Day (Monday), Marian Day (Tuesday) and Evangelization Day (Wednesday).
